# Sorting Project
Java project used to showcase sorting algorithms.

# Requirements
Write a program in Java and implement the following requirements:
1. Based on the program conditions, generate test data using a) equivalence
   partitioning, b) boundary value analysis and c) cause-effect graphing. Implemented
   tests using JUnit.
2. Determine the level of coverage achieved by each of the test sets from 1)
   a), b) and c) using one of the code coverage utilities presented. Compare and comment on the results obtained by the three sets of tests.
3. Transform the program into a directed graph and, based on it, find a
   test set that satisfies the modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) criterion.
4. Write a mutant of the 1st order equivalent to the program.
5. For one of the test cases above, write a non-equivalent mutant that will be killed by the test and a non-equivalent mutant that will not be killed by the test.

## Remarks:
1. Java can be used as a programming language that will allow writing unit tests and a cover tool.
2. A method (function, procedure) from the program can be tested, but it must be clearly mentioned and its functionality described and all requirements will be resolved based on this
   the same methods.
3. In addition to the actual program and the implemented tests, documentation will be created
   which will describe in detail how the results were obtained for each of the requirements of
   the project.
